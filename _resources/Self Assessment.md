The Court Excellence Self-Assessment Questionnaire is a self-administered instrument that can be used to determine what areas of court excellence must be addressed in the short-term and what areas require intermediate or long-term planning for quality improvement. It is the first necessary step for a court towards developing a plan to close the gap between “what is” and “what can be” as prescribed by the Framework.
